# foxi

## Futuristic Observations and their eXpected Information

Using information theory and Bayesian inference this python package computes a suite of expected utilities given futuristic observations in a flexible and user-friendly way.

In principle, all one needs to make use of foxi is a set of n-dim prior samples for each model and one set of n-dim samples from the current data.   

## The expected utilities used

The expected ln-Bayes factor between models and its maximum-likelihood averaged equivalent (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX).

The decisivity between models (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX) its maximum-likelihood averaged equivalent.

The expected Kullback-Leibler divergence (or information gain) of the futuristic dataset.
