# foxi

## Futuristic Observations and their eXpected Information

Using information theory and Bayesian inference this python package computes a suite of expected utilities given futuristic observations in a flexible and user-friendly way.

In principle, all one needs to make use of foxi is a set of n-dim prior samples for each model and one set of n-dim samples from the current data.   

## The expected utilities used

The expected ln-Bayes factor between models and its maximum-likelihood averaged equivalent (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX).

The decisivity between models (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX) its maximum-likelihood averaged equivalent.

The expected Kullback-Leibler divergence (or information gain) of the futuristic dataset.

## Main features

Flexible inputs - usable essentially for any forecasting problem in science with suitable samples.

Designed for all-in-one script calculation or an initial cluster run then local machine post-processing.

LaTeX tables and plot making for post-data analysis visuals.

User-friendly scripts with plenty of comments.

## Getting started

To clone, simply type into the terminal:
