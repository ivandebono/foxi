# Futuristic Observations and their eXpected Information

Using information theory and Bayesian inference this code computes expected utilities given futuristic observations. 

The following expected utilities are used:

The expected ln-Bayes factor between models.
The decisivity between models (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX).
The expected Kullback-Leibler divergence (or information gain) of the futuristic dataset.
