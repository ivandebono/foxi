## Futuristic Observations and their eXpected Information

Using information theory and Bayesian inference this code computes expected utilities given futuristic observations. 

## The expected utilities used

The expected ln-Bayes factor between models.

The decisivity between models (see arxiv:XXXXXXXX).

The expected Kullback-Leibler divergence (or information gain) of the futuristic dataset.
